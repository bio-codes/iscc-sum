# About ISCC-SUM

## What is ISCC?

The International Standard Content Code (ISCC) is an open standard (ISO 24138:2024) for creating unique digital
fingerprints for any type of content. Think of it as a universal identification system for digital files - like
barcodes for products, but for digital content.

## Why ISCC-SUM?

ISCC-SUM is a high-performance tool that generates these digital fingerprints up to **130 times faster** than
standard implementations. This dramatic speed improvement makes ISCC practical for:

- **Content Management Systems** - Instantly identify duplicate files across large repositories
- **Digital Archives** - Efficiently catalog and verify millions of documents
- **Media Organizations** - Track content usage and detect unauthorized copies
- **Software Development** - Verify file integrity and manage dependencies

## Key Benefits

### Lightning Fast

Process large files and entire directory trees in seconds rather than minutes or hours.

### Standards Compliant

Fully implements the ISO 24138:2024 standard, ensuring compatibility with the global ISCC ecosystem.

### Cross-Platform

Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

### Developer Friendly

Simple command-line interface familiar to anyone who has used tools like `md5sum` or `sha256sum`, plus a Python
API for integration into your applications.

## Real-World Impact

Organizations handling large volumes of digital content can now:

- Reduce storage costs by identifying duplicate files
- Protect intellectual property with verifiable content identification
- Streamline workflows with instant content verification
- Build innovative applications on top of standardized content codes

## Project Background

ISCC-SUM was developed as part of the BIO-CODES project, funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe research
and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No 101060954). This funding has enabled us to create an open-source
tool that makes advanced content identification technology accessible to everyone.
