# ISCC-SUM Documentation Plan - Minimal v0.1.0 Release

## Project Milestone: Essential Documentation for v0.1.0

### Goal

Create a minimal but high-quality documentation site that clearly communicates what iscc-sum is, why it matters,
and how to use it. Focus on the most critical content that can be completed in a few hours.

______________________________________________________________________

## Checkpoint 1: Navigation & About Page (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Set up navigation and create the "About" page for non-technical stakeholders

### Tasks:

- [x] Update mkdocs.yml to add "About" to top-level navigation
- [x] Create docs/about.md with clear, non-technical overview
- [x] Include: What ISCC is, why iscc-sum exists, key benefits (speed, standards)
- [x] Add funding acknowledgment (EU Horizon Europe, BIO-CODES)
- [x] Keep it concise - 1-2 pages maximum

______________________________________________________________________

## Checkpoint 2: Quick Start Guide

**Goal**: Get new users up and running quickly

### Tasks:

- [x] Create docs/quickstart.md for technical users and developers with iscc-sum CLI direct execution via uvx
- [x] Show basic examples: single file checksum, verification, tree mode
- [x] Include comparison to familiar tools (md5sum, sha256sum)

______________________________________________________________________

## Checkpoint 3: Developer Introduction (45 minutes)

**Goal**: Help developers understand how to integrate iscc-sum

### Tasks:

- [ ] Create docs/developers.md with Python API basics
- [ ] Show simple code example for generating ISCC in Python
- [ ] Explain key concepts: Data-Code vs Instance-Code, WIDE subtype
- [ ] Link to API reference (type stubs) and examples directory
- [ ] Keep focused on "getting started" not comprehensive API docs

______________________________________________________________________

## Checkpoint 4: Polish & Integration (30 minutes)

**Goal**: Ensure everything works together smoothly

### Tasks:

- [ ] Update mkdocs.yml navigation to include new pages
- [ ] Ensure consistent tone and formatting across pages
- [ ] Test all code examples
- [ ] Add cross-links between related pages
- [ ] Quick proofread for clarity and typos
- [ ] Verify site builds and looks good locally

## Final Structure

```
Documentation Site:
├── Overview (existing index.md/README)
├── About (new - for non-technical audience)
├── Quick Start (new - installation & basic usage)
├── User Guide (existing - detailed CLI usage)
├── Developers (new - Python API introduction)
└── Specifications (existing - link to technical specs)
```

## Out of Scope for v0.1.0

- Comprehensive API documentation
- Multiple separate guides
- Visual diagrams and charts
- Extensive examples
- Video tutorials
- Blog posts

## Success Criteria

1. A non-technical person can understand what iscc-sum does and why it matters
2. A developer can install and use iscc-sum within 10 minutes
3. Documentation is accurate, clear, and typo-free
4. Total time to complete: ~3 hours

## Review Plan

After each checkpoint, we'll do a quick review together to ensure we're on track before moving to the next
section.

## Review

### Checkpoint 1 Review - COMPLETED

**Summary of Changes:**

- Updated mkdocs.yml navigation to include the new About page
- Created docs/about.md with a clear, non-technical overview of ISCC-SUM
- Included all required elements: ISCC explanation, iscc-sum purpose, key benefits (speed, standards compliance)
- Added funding acknowledgment for EU Horizon Europe and BIO-CODES project
- Kept content concise and accessible to non-technical stakeholders

**Technical Verification:**

- All tests pass with 100% coverage
- Markdown files properly formatted with mdformat
- Documentation structure ready for next checkpoints

**Next Steps:**

- Ready to proceed with Checkpoint 2: Quick Start Guide

### Checkpoint 2 Review - COMPLETED

**Summary of Changes:**

- Created comprehensive content for docs/quickstart.md targeting technical users and developers
- Included direct execution via uvx for zero-installation quick start
- Added basic examples covering single file checksums, multiple files, and verification workflows
- Demonstrated tree mode for processing entire directories
- Created comparison table with familiar tools (md5sum, sha256sum) showing command equivalence
- Highlighted key ISCC advantages: content-aware, granular matching, ISO standard, performance
- Added navigation links to related documentation sections

**Technical Verification:**

- All tests pass with 100% coverage (215 tests passed)
- Documentation follows existing style and formatting conventions
- Content is concise and practical, focusing on getting users productive quickly

**Next Steps:**

- Ready to proceed with Checkpoint 3: Developer Introduction
