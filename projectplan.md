### Review - Checkpoint 4.1

**Summary of changes:**

- Enhanced `IgnoreSpec` structure with `PatternEntry` to track pattern metadata
- Added support for negation patterns (!) with proper parsing
- Implemented precedence-aware matching logic (last pattern wins)
- Added `has_whitelisted_content` method to allow traversal into directories with whitelisted content
- Updated `treewalk_ignore` to respect whitelisted directories
- Added comprehensive test suite for negation patterns:
  - Basic negation patterns (\*.log, !important.log)
  - Directory negation (build/, !build/dist/)
  - Cascading negation across directories
  - Precedence testing with multiple patterns
- All Rust tests passing (58 tests total, 34 treewalk tests)
- Python test coverage maintained at 100%
- All clippy warnings resolved

The negation pattern support is now fully functional and compatible with gitignore semantics.

### Checkpoint 4.1: Negation Pattern Support

**Goal**: Implement full support for gitignore-style negation patterns (!) in the IgnoreSpec.

**Context**: The globset crate does not natively support negation patterns. We need to implement this on top of
globset, similar to how ripgrep's ignore crate does it.

**Implementation approach**:

1. Track which patterns are negations (whitelist patterns) separately
2. Build separate GlobSets for ignore and whitelist patterns
3. Apply matching logic that respects precedence: later patterns override earlier ones
4. Ensure directory exclusion logic respects whitelisted directories

- [x] Enhance IgnoreSpec structure:
  - [x] Add separate tracking for negation patterns
  - [x] Store pattern metadata (is_whitelist, original_line_number)
  - [x] Modify pattern parsing to detect and handle '!' prefix
- [x] Implement two-phase matching:
  - [x] Build separate GlobSets for ignore and whitelist patterns
  - [x] Implement precedence-aware matching logic
  - [x] Handle directory whitelisting to allow traversal
- [x] Update treewalk_ignore logic:
  - [x] Check both ignore and whitelist patterns
  - [x] Apply correct precedence rules
  - [x] Allow traversal into whitelisted directories
- [x] Add comprehensive negation tests:
  - [x] Test basic negation (ignore \*.log, !important.log)
  - [x] Test directory negation (ignore build/, !build/dist/)
  - [x] Test cascading negation across directories
  - [x] Test precedence with multiple patterns
  - [x] Test edge cases (escaped !, double negation)
- [x] Ensure compatibility with Python reference implementation

### Review - Checkpoint 5

**Summary of changes:**

- Implemented `treewalk_iscc` function in `src/treewalk.rs`
- Function uses `treewalk_ignore` with `.isccignore` files as the ignore file name
- Added filtering to exclude files ending with `.iscc.json` (ISCC metadata files)
- Added comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Basic .iscc.json filtering
  - .isccignore pattern respecting
  - Cascading ignore rules with .iscc.json filtering
  - Empty directory handling
  - Error handling for non-existent paths
- All Rust tests passing (63 tests total)
- Python test coverage maintained at 100%

The treewalk_iscc implementation is complete and follows the same pattern as the Python reference
implementation.

### Checkpoint 5: Treewalk-ISCC Extension

**Goal**: Implement ISCC-specific filtering on top of treewalk-ignore.

- [x] Implement `treewalk_iscc` function:
  - [x] Use treewalk_ignore with `.isccignore` files
  - [x] Add automatic filtering of `.iscc.json` files
  - [x] Ensure proper layering of filters
- [x] Add tests for ISCC-specific behavior:
  - [x] Test .isccignore processing
  - [x] Test .iscc.json filtering
  - [x] Test interaction between filters
  - [x] Verify conformance with specification
- [x] Integration tests with existing ISCC hashing

### Checkpoint 9: Documentation and Polish

**Goal**: Ensure the implementation is production-ready with proper documentation.

- [ ] Complete documentation:
  - [ ] API documentation with examples
- [x] Code quality:
  - [x] Run clippy and fix all warnings
  - [x] Ensure consistent error messages
  - [x] Review and if necessary refactor for clarity
- [x] Final testing:
  - [x] Run full test suite
  - [x] Verify spec compliance
