# ISCC-SUM CLI Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of the `iscc-sum` CLI tool using Python's Click framework. The tool will
implement the ISCC (International Standard Content Code) checksum functionality as specified in
`docs/cli-spec.md`, leveraging the existing Rust core library through PyO3 bindings.

## Architecture Overview

- **CLI Layer**: Click-based command-line interface (`iscc_sum/cli.py`)
- **Core Processing**: Utilizes existing Rust implementations via Python bindings
- **Verification Logic**: Python implementation for checksum verification
- **Similarity Matching**: Python implementation using hamming distance calculations
- **I/O Handling**: Efficient file reading with 2MB chunks, stdin support
